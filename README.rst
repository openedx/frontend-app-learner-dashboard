frontend-app-learner-dashboard
==============================

The Learner Home app is a microfrontend (MFE) course listing experience for the Open edX Learning Management System
(LMS).  This experience was designed to provide a clean and functional interface to allow learners to view all of their
open enrollments, as well as take relevant actions on those enrollments.  It also serves as host to a number of exposed
"widget" containers to provide upsell and discovery widgets as sidebar/footer components.

Quickstart
----------

To start the MFE and enable the feature in LMS:

1. Start the MFE with ``npm run start``. Take a note of the path/port (defaults to ``http://localhost:1996``).

From there, simply load the configured address/port.  You should be prompted to log into your LMS if you are not
already, and then redirected to your home page.

Plugins
-------
This MFE can be customized using `Frontend Plugin Framework <https://github.com/openedx/frontend-plugin-framework>`_.

The parts of this MFE that can be customized in that manner are documented `here </src/plugin-slots>`_.
